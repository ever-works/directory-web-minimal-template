# Ever Works — Minimal Directory Web Template

## Project Overview

This is a **minimal, static-rendered Astro template** for AI-generated directory websites. It serves as a lightweight alternative to the full-featured Next.js `directory-web-template`. Users choose between the full Next.js template or this minimal Astro template that AI tools build upon.

**Key philosophy**: This template is an intentionally blank canvas with headless, composable building blocks. AI agents (Claude Code, etc.) assemble and style these components into complete directory websites.

## Architecture

- **Framework**: Astro 5 with Vite, fully static rendering (`output: 'static'`), NO SSR
- **Language**: TypeScript everywhere — no JS, no Python
- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
- **Data**: Git-first — data stored in separate Git repos (YAML files), NO database, NO auth
- **UI**: Headless, unstyled composable components — AI applies styling
- **Deployment**: Vercel via GitHub Actions

## Monorepo Structure

## Critical Rules

1. **TypeScript only** — No `.js`, `.py`, or any non-TS source files
2. **No database** — All data comes from Git repos via YAML files
3. **No auth** — No user accounts, sessions, or authentication
4. **No payments** — No billing, subscriptions, or payment providers
5. **No SSR** — Fully static output only (`astro build` produces static HTML)
6. **Plugin everything** — Almost every feature must be a plugin. Core should be minimal.
7. **Git-first data** — Default data storage is Git repos. No DB, no custom storage.
8. **Extreme performance** — Every decision optimizes for speed
9. **Modular & replaceable** — Every component, adapter, and plugin can be swapped
10. **AI-optimized** — Clear naming, inline docs, explicit data contracts

## Data Source

The template connects to the same git-backed data repositories as the full Next.js template:

```
.content/
├── config.yml            — Site configuration
├── categories.yml        — Category definitions
├── tags.yml              — Tag definitions
├── collections.yml       — Collection definitions
├── data/
│   └── <item-slug>/
│       └── <item-slug>.yml  — Item data (YAML frontmatter)
├── comparisons/          — Item comparison data
└── pages/                — Static pages (Markdown)
```

**Environment variables:**
- `DATA_REPOSITORY` — GitHub URL of content repo (required)
- `GH_TOKEN` — GitHub PAT for private repos (optional)
- `GITHUB_BRANCH` — Branch to sync (default: `main`)

## Common Commands

```bash
pnpm install              # Install all dependencies
pnpm dev                  # Start all dev servers
pnpm dev:web              # Start only the web app
pnpm dev:docs             # Start only the docs site
pnpm build                # Build all apps
pnpm lint                 # Lint all packages
pnpm typecheck            # Type-check all packages
pnpm test                 # Run all unit tests (Vitest)
pnpm test:e2e             # Run E2E tests (Playwright)
pnpm clean                # Clean all build artifacts
```

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode
- No `any` types — use `unknown` and narrow
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use barrel files (`index.ts`) for public APIs
- Function components for UI (no classes)
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Small, focused files — one concern per file
- Inline JSDoc comments on public APIs and data contracts

## Package Naming

- Workspace packages: `@ever-works/<name>`
- Plugins: `@ever-works/plugin-<name>`
- Adapters: `@ever-works/adapter-<name>`
- UI components: `@ever-works/ui`

## Safe Operations

These commands are always safe to run:
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm dev` / `pnpm dev:web` / `pnpm dev:docs`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm test:e2e`
- `pnpm clean`

## Before Making Changes

1. Read the relevant spec in `.specify/` or `docs/`
2. Check `docs/questions.md` for open decisions
3. Ensure changes align with the plugin architecture
4. Verify TypeScript strict compliance
5. Run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` after changes

## React Composition Patterns

Composition patterns for building flexible, maintainable React components. Avoid boolean prop proliferation by using compound components, lifting state, and composing internals. These patterns make codebases easier for both humans and AI agents to work with as they scale.

- `.claude/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/AGENTS.md`: **Version 1.0.0** Engineering January 2026
- `.claude/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/README.md`: A structured repository for React composition patterns that scale. These patterns help avoid boolean prop proliferation by using compound components, lifting state, and composing internals.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/rules/_sections.md`: This file defines all sections, their ordering, impact levels, and descriptions. The section ID (in parentheses) is the filename prefix used to group rules.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/rules/_template.md`: Brief explanation of the rule and why it matters.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/rules/architecture-avoid-boolean-props.md`: Don't add boolean props like `isThread`, `isEditing`, `isDMThread` to customize component behavior. Each boolean doubles possible states and creates unmaintainable conditional logic. Use composition instead.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/rules/architecture-compound-components.md`: Structure complex components as compound components with a shared context. Each subcomponent accesses shared state via context, not props. Consumers compose the pieces they need.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/rules/patterns-children-over-render-props.md`: Use `children` for composition instead of `renderX` props. Children are more readable, compose naturally, and don't require understanding callback signatures.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/rules/patterns-explicit-variants.md`: Instead of one component with many boolean props, create explicit variant components. Each variant composes the pieces it needs. The code documents itself.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/rules/react19-no-forwardref.md`: In React 19, `ref` is now a regular prop (no `forwardRef` wrapper needed), and `use()` replaces `useContext()`.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/rules/state-context-interface.md`: Define a **generic interface** for your component context with three parts: can implement—enabling the same UI components to work with completely different state implementations.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/rules/state-decouple-implementation.md`: The provider component should be the only place that knows how state is managed. UI components consume the context interface—they don't know if state comes from useState, Zustand, or a server sync.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/rules/state-lift-state.md`: Move state management into dedicated provider components. This allows sibling components outside the main UI to access and modify state without prop drilling or awkward refs.

- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/README.md`: A structured repository for creating and maintaining React Best Practices optimized for agents and LLMs.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/_sections.md`: This file defines all sections, their ordering, impact levels, and descriptions. The section ID (in parentheses) is the filename prefix used to group rules.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/_template.md`: **Impact: MEDIUM (optional impact description)**
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/advanced-effect-event-deps.md`: Effect Event functions do not have a stable identity. Their identity intentionally changes on every render. Do not include the function returned by `useEffectEvent` in a `useEffect` dependency array. Keep the actual reactive values as dependencies and call the Effect Event from inside the effect...
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/advanced-event-handler-refs.md`: Store callbacks in refs when used in effects that shouldn't re-subscribe on callback changes.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/advanced-init-once.md`: Do not put app-wide initialization that must run once per app load inside `useEffect([])` of a component. Components can remount and effects will re-run. Use a module-level guard or top-level init in the entry module instead.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/advanced-use-latest.md`: Access latest values in callbacks without adding them to dependency arrays. Prevents effect re-runs while avoiding stale closures.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/async-api-routes.md`: In API routes and Server Actions, start independent operations immediately, even if you don't await them yet.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/async-cheap-condition-before-await.md`: When a branch uses `await` for a flag or remote value and also requires a **cheap synchronous** condition (local props, request metadata, already-loaded state), evaluate the cheap condition **first**. Otherwise you pay for the async call even when the compound condition can never be true.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/async-defer-await.md`: Move `await` operations into the branches where they're actually used to avoid blocking code paths that don't need them.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/async-dependencies.md`: For operations with partial dependencies, use `better-all` to maximize parallelism. It automatically starts each task at the earliest possible moment.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/async-parallel.md`: When async operations have no interdependencies, execute them concurrently using `Promise.all()`.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/async-suspense-boundaries.md`: Instead of awaiting data in async components before returning JSX, use Suspense boundaries to show the wrapper UI faster while data loads.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/bundle-barrel-imports.md`: Import directly from source files instead of barrel files to avoid loading thousands of unused modules. **Barrel files** are entry points that re-export multiple modules (e.g., `index.js` that does `export * from './module'`).
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/bundle-conditional.md`: Load large data or modules only when a feature is activated.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/bundle-defer-third-party.md`: Analytics, logging, and error tracking don't block user interaction. Load them after hydration.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/bundle-dynamic-imports.md`: Use `next/dynamic` to lazy-load large components not needed on initial render.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/bundle-preload.md`: Preload heavy bundles before they're needed to reduce perceived latency.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/client-event-listeners.md`: Use `useSWRSubscription()` to share global event listeners across component instances.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/client-localstorage-schema.md`: Add version prefix to keys and store only needed fields. Prevents schema conflicts and accidental storage of sensitive data.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/client-passive-event-listeners.md`: Add `{ passive: true }` to touch and wheel event listeners to enable immediate scrolling. Browsers normally wait for listeners to finish to check if `preventDefault()` is called, causing scroll delay.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/client-swr-dedup.md`: SWR enables request deduplication, caching, and revalidation across component instances.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/js-batch-dom-css.md`: Avoid interleaving style writes with layout reads. When you read a layout property (like `offsetWidth`, `getBoundingClientRect()`, or `getComputedStyle()`) between style changes, the browser is forced to trigger a synchronous reflow.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/js-cache-function-results.md`: Use a module-level Map to cache function results when the same function is called repeatedly with the same inputs during render.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/js-cache-property-access.md`: Cache object property lookups in hot paths.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/js-cache-storage.md`: **Incorrect (reads storage on every call):**
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/js-combine-iterations.md`: Multiple `.filter()` or `.map()` calls iterate the array multiple times. Combine into one loop.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/js-early-exit.md`: Return early when result is determined to skip unnecessary processing.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/js-flatmap-filter.md`: **Impact: LOW-MEDIUM (eliminates intermediate array)**
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/js-hoist-regexp.md`: Don't create RegExp inside render. Hoist to module scope or memoize with `useMemo()`.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/js-index-maps.md`: Multiple `.find()` calls by the same key should use a Map.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/js-length-check-first.md`: When comparing arrays with expensive operations (sorting, deep equality, serialization), check lengths first. If lengths differ, the arrays cannot be equal.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/js-min-max-loop.md`: Finding the smallest or largest element only requires a single pass through the array. Sorting is wasteful and slower.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/js-request-idle-callback.md`: **Impact: MEDIUM (keeps UI responsive during background tasks)**
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/js-set-map-lookups.md`: Convert arrays to Set/Map for repeated membership checks.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/js-tosorted-immutable.md`: **Incorrect (mutates original array):**
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rendering-activity.md`: Use React's `<Activity>` to preserve state/DOM for expensive components that frequently toggle visibility.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rendering-animate-svg-wrapper.md`: Many browsers don't have hardware acceleration for CSS3 animations on SVG elements. Wrap SVG in a `<div>` and animate the wrapper instead.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rendering-conditional-render.md`: Use explicit ternary operators (`? :`) instead of `&&` for conditional rendering when the condition can be `0`, `NaN`, or other falsy values that render.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rendering-content-visibility.md`: Apply `content-visibility: auto` to defer off-screen rendering.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rendering-hoist-jsx.md`: Extract static JSX outside components to avoid re-creation.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rendering-hydration-no-flicker.md`: When rendering content that depends on client-side storage (localStorage, cookies), avoid both SSR breakage and post-hydration flickering by injecting a synchronous script that updates the DOM before React hydrates.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rendering-hydration-suppress-warning.md`: In SSR frameworks (e.g., Next.js), some values are intentionally different on server vs client (random IDs, dates, locale/timezone formatting). For these *expected* mismatches, wrap the dynamic text in an element with `suppressHydrationWarning` to prevent noisy warnings. Do not use this to hide r...
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rendering-resource-hints.md`: **Impact: HIGH (reduces load time for critical resources)**
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rendering-script-defer-async.md`: **Impact: HIGH (eliminates render-blocking)**
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rendering-svg-precision.md`: Reduce SVG coordinate precision to decrease file size. The optimal precision depends on the viewBox size, but in general reducing precision should be considered.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rendering-usetransition-loading.md`: Use `useTransition` instead of manual `useState` for loading states. This provides built-in `isPending` state and automatically manages transitions.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rerender-defer-reads.md`: Don't subscribe to dynamic state (searchParams, localStorage) if you only read it inside callbacks.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rerender-dependencies.md`: Specify primitive dependencies instead of objects to minimize effect re-runs.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rerender-derived-state-no-effect.md`: If a value can be computed from current props/state, do not store it in state or update it in an effect. Derive it during render to avoid extra renders and state drift. Do not set state in effects solely in response to prop changes; prefer derived values or keyed resets instead.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rerender-derived-state.md`: Subscribe to derived boolean state instead of continuous values to reduce re-render frequency.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rerender-functional-setstate.md`: When updating state based on the current state value, use the functional update form of setState instead of directly referencing the state variable. This prevents stale closures, eliminates unnecessary dependencies, and creates stable callback references.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rerender-lazy-state-init.md`: Pass a function to `useState` for expensive initial values. Without the function form, the initializer runs on every render even though the value is only used once.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rerender-memo-with-default-value.md`: When memoized component has a default value for some non-primitive optional parameter, such as an array, function, or object, calling the component without that parameter results in broken memoization. This is because new value instances are created on every rerender, and they do not pass strict...
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rerender-memo.md`: Extract expensive work into memoized components to enable early returns before computation.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rerender-move-effect-to-event.md`: If a side effect is triggered by a specific user action (submit, click, drag), run it in that event handler. Do not model the action as state + effect; it makes effects re-run on unrelated changes and can duplicate the action.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rerender-no-inline-components.md`: **Impact: HIGH (prevents remount on every render)**
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rerender-simple-expression-in-memo.md`: When an expression is simple (few logical or arithmetical operators) and has a primitive result type (boolean, number, string), do not wrap it in `useMemo`. Calling `useMemo` and comparing hook dependencies may consume more resources than the expression itself.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rerender-split-combined-hooks.md`: When a hook contains multiple independent tasks with different dependencies, split them into separate hooks. A combined hook reruns all tasks when any dependency changes, even if some tasks don't use the changed value.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rerender-transitions.md`: Mark frequent, non-urgent state updates as transitions to maintain UI responsiveness.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rerender-use-deferred-value.md`: When user input triggers expensive computations or renders, use `useDeferredValue` to keep the input responsive. The deferred value lags behind, allowing React to prioritize the input update and render the expensive result when idle.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/rerender-use-ref-transient-values.md`: When a value changes frequently and you don't want a re-render on every update (e.g., mouse trackers, intervals, transient flags), store it in `useRef` instead of `useState`. Keep component state for UI; use refs for temporary DOM-adjacent values. Updating a ref does not trigger a re-render.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/server-after-nonblocking.md`: Use Next.js's `after()` to schedule work that should execute after a response is sent. This prevents logging, analytics, and other side effects from blocking the response.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/server-auth-actions.md`: **Impact: CRITICAL (prevents unauthorized access to server mutations)**
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/server-cache-lru.md`: **Implementation:**
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/server-cache-react.md`: Use `React.cache()` for server-side request deduplication. Authentication and database queries benefit most.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/server-dedup-props.md`: **Impact: LOW (reduces network payload by avoiding duplicate serialization)**
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/server-hoist-static-io.md`: **Impact: HIGH (avoids repeated file/network I/O per request)**
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/server-no-shared-module-state.md`: For React Server Components and client components rendered during SSR, avoid using mutable module-level variables to share request-scoped data. Server renders can run concurrently in the same process. If one render writes to shared module state and another render reads it, you can get race condit...
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/server-parallel-fetching.md`: React Server Components execute sequentially within a tree. Restructure with composition to parallelize data fetching.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/server-parallel-nested-fetching.md`: When fetching nested data in parallel, chain dependent fetches within each item's promise so a slow item doesn't block the rest.
- `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/server-serialization.md`: The React Server/Client boundary serializes all object properties into strings and embeds them in the HTML response and subsequent RSC requests. This serialized data directly impacts page weight and load time, so **size matters a lot**. Only pass fields that the client actually uses.
